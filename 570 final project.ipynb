    "The purpose of our project is to find the relationship between gender and change of Hukou status and inter-provincial migration patterns in China, which is tied up with a traditional Chinese ideology of preference for sons over daughters.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Hukou” is a system of household registration in China with the aim of managing the population and safeguarding the basic rights of citizens in employment, education and social welfare. The division of hukou status into agricultural and non-agricultural accounts creates a wealth gap and greatly increases the cost of hukou transfer. There is ample research evidence to show that the consequence of such hukou status differences is not gender equality, but rather greater transfer costs for women, especially for those in rural areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Inter-provincial migration\" is more informal since it does not have to acquire the formal Hukou. Despite of no hukou requirement, there are still many factors that constrain women's migration in China, where patriarchy is deeply entrenched.\n",
    "\n",
    "The link stems mainly from a traditional Chinese ideology of preference sons to daughters. In the old traditional feudal familym, only men were eligible heirs to the family, since women were no longer member of the original family when they married. So a family must have at least one boy, and if the first few children are all girls, they will continue to have children until a boy is born.Although this backward concept of family inheritance has gradually faded in modern Chinese society, it is inevitable that some families still prefer boys to girls, and in these families, more good resources are given to boys. A fairly typical example is that in rural areas, older sisters will drop out of school at an early age and work in cities to support their younger brothers. Even in families with only daughters, strong patriarchal attitudes can make education and other resources less secure for girls, because parents feel that girls do not need to pursue higher education or have a high social status.\n",
    "\n",
    "These traditional concepts result in two different outcomes of female in hukou transition and inter-provincial migration. On the one hand, although women move to other cities or provinces to live and work, this does not change the status of their hukou, because the cost and threshold to transfer from agricultural hukou to non-agricultural hukou is very high. Also, there may be resistance from their original family who don't want their daughter live too far from them. On the other hand, working in cities also increases the possibility to obtain urban status hukou. Moreover, for some of them, escaping shackles of their original families stimulates them to work hard to stay in cities or places far from their hometowns. The following models will examine which force prevail in reality."

    "Liu,Z.(2003) found that people who switch from agricultural to urban hukou tend to have a lower standard of living than thoes who are originally urban citizens. They often have limited access to education, medical, public welfare  resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fan,C.C.(2000) examined the different patterns of cross-provincial migration between males and females. Geographically, males migrate more to the western and central parts of China, while females migrate more to the eastern areas where the third industry is more developed; motivationally, males' migration motivation are mainly business, job transfer and study, while females' are mainly marriage and business; in addition, females' average migration distance is longer and net movement between adjacent provinces is less compared to males' inter-provincial migration. \n",
    "\n",
    "In another paper by Fan,C.C.(2003) where she particularly discussed rural-urban migration and gender division of labor, she pointed out a latent factor of the survival of the traditional patriarchy in modern China, which is the transitional phase in China that differs from its socialist period as well as the capitalist economies by “prioritizing economic goals and making peasants more vulnerable” and by “continued prominence of the state”, leaving room for the Confucianism originated socio-economic traditions to re-breed. She also addressed that the transition is not gender-neutral, but instead potentially facilitates labor division, which keeps undermining the circumstances of women in rural areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ) as a case study, Liang,Z. and Chen,Y.P.(2004) further explained the reason of female migration. Their finding is consistent with Fan(2000)'s view, which happened before the establishment of SEZ; However, after the establishment of SEZ, this situation has changed dramatically, with 80% of female moving to Shenzhen for business and work purposes. In addition, he pointed out that women are helped to improve their social status by raising their educational level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above articles and other relevant literature have made rather thorough discussions on gender, change of Hukou status and inter-provincial migration. Education is one of the essential linkages between gender and Hukou or migration; What's more, our study adds another layer of patriarchy within the family represented by the feature of siblings of women and examines a more detailed chain reaction from gender to migration.

    "The change of Hukou status is a 0 and 1 variable that takes one if the subject’s current Hukou status is different from that in his/her childhood. There are two different ways of measurements of the change of Hukou status to ensure the robustness of the results: the first one is whether there is a difference in Hukou status between the present and the age of 3, the second one is between the present and the age of 12. Using the two measurements, on average, there are 16% and 14% of the sample respectively have changed their Hukou status.\n",

Since the provinces of living at age 3 and 12 are not available in this dataset, we use the province of birth place as the proxy of their original living provinces instead. There are also two different ways of measurements for their current living provinces: the first measurement uses the province that the subjects took the survey, while the second uses their current Hukou province. There are about 8% and 6% of the sample respectively had gone through inter-provincial migration.\n",

In the sample, there are “only children” who had no siblings and also ones with 15 siblings at maximum. The mean of the interaction terms gender * younger brother indicates that among the samples, 24.5% are female and have (had) one or more younger brother(s).

    "The models are binary response regressions on a series of explanatory variables of gender and siblings using the Linear Probability Model (LPM). In the basis specification where no covaraites are incorporated, the change of Hukou status and the migration variables are regressed on the number of siblings and its quadratic form, the dummy variable of gender, the interaction term of gender and the younger-brother dummy, and the interaction term of gender and the number of siblings. The quadratic term of the number of siblings is to examine if there is an (inverted) U-shape relationship between siblings and the explained variables. The basic model is specified as $Pr(y_i=1)=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 * number of siblings_i +\\beta_2 * number of siblings_i^2 +\\beta_3 * gender_i + \\beta_4 * gender * youngbro_i + \\beta_5 * gender * number of siblings_i$ , where $Pr(y_i=1)$ is the probability of changes in Hukou status and the probability of inter-provincial migration for individual i.\n",

This is based on the Hukou registration law, where marriage and education are two key factors in deciding whether a permit for the transfer of Hukou status can be issued to the applicant, and in affecting individuals’ decisions in the place of settlement. Age is controlled since the wealth and experience that affect one’s Hukou status and migration behavior accumulate over time. The extended model is as follows: $Pr(y_i=1)=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 * number of siblings_i +\\beta_2 * number of siblings_i^2 +\\beta_3 * gender_i + \\beta_4 * gender * youngbro_i + \\beta_5 * gender * number of siblings_i + \\beta_6 * marital status_i + \\beta_7 * gender * marital status_i + \\beta_8 * education_i * \\beta_9 * gender * education_i + \\alpha * age_i$ Interaction terms are to examine the specific effects on women. To be specific, incorporation of educational attainment helps detect patriarchy that does not directly affect explained variables through siblings and brothers but educational opportunities. \n",

    "The number of siblings exhibits a linear positive correlation with the probability of Hukou status. However, for females, this effect is almost offset by the negative coefficient of the interaction term. Therefore, for women with siblings, there is not much possibility to change their Hukou status. The positive coefficient of the interaction between gender and younger brother suggests that women with younger brothers are more likely to change their Hukou status, indicating that the positive force prevails in this case. \n",

However, when it comes to being divorced or widowed, women would be more inclined to change Hukou status, which means marriage brings burden on women, disengagement from the marriage makes women dominance in dominance on important life events such as place of residence, instead of being influenced by their husbands. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for education, the males will have a higher possibility to change the Hukou status, especially this could be certain for the male who has a doctoral degree. For women who dropped out of school after senior school, it will be also easier for them to change the Hukou status. The negative term of doctoral degree for women indicates that it is less more possible for women with high educational level to change their Hukou status compared with men. There are many explanations for this result, such as gender discrimination in the workplace, inability to find support from her family, or a strong sense of belonging to her hometown, all of which could be true.\n",

    "The coefficients presents a U-shape relation between the number of siblings and migration for the male benchmark group. For female group, the relation shows a 2% increase in the possibility of migration for women. For the female individuals who have brothers, it is even easier to have inter-provincial migration in order to support their family members. This is probably related to working at younger ages in other places to support their younger brothers. \n",

Women who have lower than 3 years of undergraduate education will have a higher possibility for inter-provincial migration compared to men. However, for women who attained higher education including bachelor's, master and doctoral degrees, inter-provincial migration seems to be less seen than men.\n",

    "1. Although women on average have lower rates of Hukou status change and higher rates of migration, the net effect of patriarchy in the family on female Hukou status change and inter-provincial migration is unexpected positive, even though on a relatively small margin. This is probably because patriarchal power in the family may be more of an incentive for girls to leave original families for job opportunities at the expense of education, resulting in higher probabilities of inter-provincial migration and thus a higher chance of changing their Hukou status.\n",

Instead, females with lower educational levels tend to have higher rates of Hukou status change and inter-provincial migration probably due to early work. "
